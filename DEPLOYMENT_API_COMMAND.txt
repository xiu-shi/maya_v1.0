# AI Builders Space - Redeploy with Environment Variable

## Current Issue:
- maya-agent is deployed but status is "Degraded"  
- System prompt file (system_prompt.txt) is gitignored and NOT in GitHub repo
- Service can't load system instructions
- Need to set SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION environment variable

## Solution: Contact Instructor

According to AI Builders Space platform:
"Service management: To delete a service or extend hosting, contact your instructor"

**Contact: Yan Wang (范哥)**

**Request**: Please set environment variable for maya-agent deployment:
- Variable Name: `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`
- Variable Value: [Provide your 451-line system prompt]

## Alternative: If API access is available

If you have an API key that allows deployment with environment variables:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://space.ai-builders.com/backend/v1/deployments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/xiu-shi/maya_v1.0",
    "service_name": "maya-agent",
    "branch": "main",
    "port": 3000,
    "env": {
      "SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION": "..."
    }
  }'
```

Note: Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key from Settings page.
Note: Replace "..." with your full 451-line system prompt content.

## Current System Prompt Location:
Local file: Maya/backend/system_prompt.txt (451 lines)
Status: Gitignored (NOT on GitHub) - This is correct for IP protection
The prompt is currently in your clipboard - ready to paste!
